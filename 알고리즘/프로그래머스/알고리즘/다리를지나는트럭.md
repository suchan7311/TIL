# 풀이

```python
from collections import deque


def solution(bridge_length, weight, truck_weights):
    answer = 0
    cur_weight = 0
    truck_weights = deque(truck_weights)
    q = deque([0 for _ in range(bridge_length)])
    while len(q) > 0:
        cur_weight -= q.popleft()
        if len(truck_weights) :
            if cur_weight + truck_weights[0] <= weight:
                cur_weight += truck_weights[0]
                q.append(truck_weights[0])
                truck_weights.popleft()
            else:
                q.append(0)

        answer += 1
    return answer
```
